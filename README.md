## Data Cleaning with Python for Amazon Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook detailing the data cleaning process applied to an Amazon dataset using Python.

### Data Cleaning Process:

1. **Data Inspection:** Initial exploration of the dataset to identify issues.
2. **Handling Missing Data:** Techniques like imputation or removal were used.
3. **Data Standardization:** Ensured uniform data format.
4. **Removing Duplicates:** Eliminated redundant entries.
5. **Data Transformation:** Converted data types and normalized values.

By cleaning the dataset thoroughly, it's now ready for analysis.

### Code Overview:

The notebook uses Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas for efficient data cleaning. Each step is demonstrated with code snippets.

### Features:

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas
- **Dataset:** Amazon dataset
- **Tasks:** Inspection, Missing Data, Standardization, Duplicates, Transformation
